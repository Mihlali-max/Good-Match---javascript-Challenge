 <p id="intro">A local tennis club has decided to organise a tournament open to the general public as a way to 
    promote tennis and the club itself.
    They have advertised widely and received many responses from people that are interested. As 
    with any major tennis tournament there will be a mixed doubles event. Partners will be allocated 
    according to an algorithm they have devised and you have been approached to write the program.
